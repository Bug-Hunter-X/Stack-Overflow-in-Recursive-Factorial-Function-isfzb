This repository contains a Hack program demonstrating a common error in recursive functions: stack overflow due to unbounded recursion. The `foo` function calculates the factorial, but it doesn't handle negative inputs, leading to infinite recursion.  The solution demonstrates how to add error handling to prevent this issue.
